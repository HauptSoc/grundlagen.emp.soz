> One of Tufte's ideas is data-to-ink ratio, generally stating that when creating a visualization, you should try to maximize the amount of "ink" (physical or digital) used to represent the data, and minimize the amount used to represent everything else not important to understanding.

Gestalt Principles

[Gestalt psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology) is a theory of perception that believes humans are inclined to understand objects as an entire structure rather than the sum of its parts.

> The Figure and Ground Principle describes the capacity to perceive the relationship between form and surrounding space to create meaning. A sense of wholeness or unity depends on how you perceive the relationship between an object and the area in which it is contained. The 'figure' is the focus element, while the 'ground' is the figure's background.
